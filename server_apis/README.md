# Carbon Black Server API 

BETA DOCUMENTATION - HIGHLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE

## Overview

Carbon Black 4.2+ supports a rich array of asynchronous server-side notifications.

This document describes these notifications, how to subscribe to these notifications, and the format of the notifications themselves.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience of this document is composed of two inter-related groups:

* Developers that wish to programmatically consume Carbon Black events
* Technologists that wish to take a peek "under the hood" of the Carbon Black server to better understand the inner workings

## Using the Carbon Black Server API

The Carbon Black Server API (CBSAPI) is found on github at:

  https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi/server_apis

The CBSAPI is a collection of documentation, example scripts, and a helper library to help subscribe to Carbon Black server notifications, parse and understand the contents of those notifications, and demonstrate common business logic uses of those notifications.

There is no requirement that the helper library be used. The helper library and example scripts are written in Python, but many common languages include all the underlying support required in order to subscribe to notifications from the Carbon Black server.  This includes Java and C/C++. 

### Getting started with CBSAPI

#### install git as needed

This step, and all subsequent steps, should be performed on a server with Carbon Black installed.
    
    [root@localhost carbonblack]# yum install git
    ...

#### clone the github cbapi repository:

    [root@localhost carbonblack]# git clone https://github.com/carbonblack/cbapi.git
    Initialized empty Git repository in /root/repos/carbonblack/cbapi/.git/

    Resolving deltas: 100% (50/50), done.
    remote: Total 105 (delta 10), reused 0 (delta 0)

#### navigate to the newly-created cbapi/python/example directory

    [root@localhost repos]# pwd
    /root/repos
    [root@localhost repos]# cd cbapi/server_apis/python/example/
    [root@localhost example]# ls
    subscribe_all.py
    [root@localhost example]# 

#### install the pika package

The example scripts depend on the "Pika" package.  Documentation is available at http://pika.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

    [root@localhost example]# easy_install pika

#### use the example "subscribe_all.py" to see all event notifications on the Carbon Black server.

    [TODO]

## Notification Architecture

The Carbon Black server uses the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) to publish events of interest.  Any AMQP compliant client can subscribe to these notifications. 

## Notification Format 

All CBSAPI notifications are published in one of two formats:

* JSON 
* Google Protobufs (https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)

The documentation below calls out in which format each notification type is published. 

## Notification Mechanisms

This document describes the underlying events published on the Carbon Black server message bus.  It is expected that these events will be consumed programmatically.

The Carbon Black server provides built-in mechanisms to expose these same events via syslog, e-mail, and HTTP POST.  The configuration of these alternate notification mechanisms is outside of the scope of this document.

## Notification Types

* Watchlist hit
  * Process Watchlist
  * Binary Watchlist
* Feed hit
  * Ingress
    * Process Ingress Feed Hit
    * Binary Ingress Feed Hit
  * Storage
    * Process Storage Feed Hit
    * Binary Storage Feed Hit
* New binary instance
  * First instance of any endpoint observing a particular binary
  * First instance of an endpoint observing a particular binary
  * First instance of a sensor group observing a particular binary
* Binary file upload complete
* Raw endpoint events

### Watchlist Hit  

There are two types of watchlists:

* Process Watchlists
* Binary Watchlists

On watchlist "hit" (match), an event is published.  The bulk of the contents of the event is pulled from the underlying process or binary document.  As such, the event fields are different between the two event types.

#### Process Watchlist Hit

### Feed Hit

There are two types of feed events:

* Ingress
* Storage

Ingress feed events are published as the matching endpoint data arrives from the sensor.  These ingress feed events therefore provide the earliest available notification of the endpoint activity.  Ingress events are published prior to updating the data to the backend data store (SOLR), and therefore it may be up to twenty minutes before the data is discoverable via search.

Storage feed events are published as the data is committed to the backend data store. These storage feed events are published upon updating the data store, but prior to committing the changes.  Threfore, it may be up to ten minutes before the data is discoverble via search. 

#### Ingress Feed Hit

##### Process Ingress Feed Hit

Name: `feed.ingress.hit.process`

`feed.ingress.hit.process` is a JSON structure with the following entries:

    }
```

Notes: It can be up to 15 seconds from the time of the event generation until the document is visible via CBAPI or raw SOLR query.

### New Binary Instance

The Carbon Black server publishes events the first time an executable file (binary) is observed in each of three scenarios:

1. First time it is observed on *any* endpoint
2. First time it is observed on an *individual* endpoint for the first time
3. First time it is observed on a sensor group for the first time

#### Scenario 1: Observed for the first time on any endpoint

    [TODO] alliance feed scores
}
```

#### New Binary File Arrival

The Carbon Black server can be configured to store a copy of all unique binary (executable) files observed on endpoints.  This includes Windows PE files such as EXEs and DLLs, Linux ELF files, and similar.  Upon the arrival of a new binary file, a binarystore event is published.

This event provides an easy way to trigger custom analysis of a binary, including static or dynamic anaysis, integration with a third-party analysis system, or custom archiving.

Name: `binarystore.file.added`
 
`binarystore.file.added` is a JSON structure with the following entries:

| name             | type     | description | 
| -----------------|----------|-------------| 
| `md5`            | string   | MD5 sum of the binary file. | 
| `size`           | int32    | Size of the original binary, in bytes. |
| `ioc_type`       | int32    | Size of the zip archive containing the binary file on the Carbon Black server | 
| `event_timestamp`| float    | Timestamp of the binary file addtion, measured in number of seconds since the epoch 

Example Event:

```
{
    "md5": "9E4B0E7472B4CEBA9E17F440B8CB0AB8",
    "size": 320000,
    "compressed_size": 126857,
    "event_timestamp": 1397248033.914
}
```
Notes:

* The Carbon Black Alliance client can be configured to delete binary store files from the Carbon Black server after uploading to the Alliance Server.  These files are still retrievable via the Carbon Black API, although there may be bandwidth or transfer time concerns. 

#### Raw Endpoint Events

The Carbon Black Server can be configured to publish some or all raw endpoint events as collected by the attached sensors.

These events are the raw endpoint events and are exported:

* upon arrival on the Carbon Black server
* prior to processing, storage, and indexing on the Carbon Black server.

The raw events themselves are published in Google Protobuffers format (https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/).  This is the same format used by the sensors themselves to encode the raw events. 

The raw event volume can easily be measured in tens of thousands per second.  The Carbon Black server can be configured to export only specific event types in order to reduce the performance impact of event export.

##### Raw Endpoint Event Types

* File modification
  * File Creation
  * File Deletion
  * File First-Written-To
  * File Last-Written-To
* Registry modification
  * Registry Key Creation
  * Registry Key Deletion
  * Registry Value Write
  * Registry Value Deletion
* Network Connection
* Process
  * Process creation
  * Process termination
* Binary information

##### Configuring the Carbon Black server to export raw endpoint events

The Carbon Black server can be configured to export some or all raw endpoint events by modifying cb.conf, found at `/etc/cb/cb.conf`. 

In particular, the following configuration option:

    `DatastoreBroadcastEventTypes=<TYPE[S]>`

The supported types are:

| type         | description | 
| -------------|-------------| 
| *            | all endpoint events|
| moduleload   | Binary module loads (for example, DLLs on Windows)|
| netconn      | Network connections|
| filemod      | File modifications|
| regmod       | Registry modifications|
| process      | Process creation and termination|
| moduleinfo   | Binary module information|

Multiple types can be specified using a comma delimiter, without spaces.

##### Google Protocol Buffers definition

The Google Protocol Buffers definition for all raw endpoint events is found at:

    `proto/sensor_events.proto`

##### Subscribing to raw endpoint events

(1) Update cb.conf as per the above instructions. 
(2) Restart cb-enterprise:

    `service cb-enterprise restart`

(3) Subscribe to the events programmatically.  See the example below for one means to do that.
